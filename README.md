This repository is to create Page Object Model in Selenium for testing the following website: https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/. 
In the class magentoTest.java I am testing Creating an Account functionality
In the class magentoTestShoppingCart I am testing the add to cart functionality
In the class E2E_MagentoTesting I am performing end to end testing of the website covering the whole flow.
We need to create 3 tests to cover the following scenarios:

 1. Register an account.
2. I have created 2 tests registerAccount1/2 in magentoTests class
 2. Add 2 products in the shopping cart and click proceed to checkout.
3. created tests for adding to cart in magentoTestShoppingCart class
 3. End to end test where we cover the whole flow(register accout, adding two products, proceed to checkout, payment etc).
